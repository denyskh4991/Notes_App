# Notes_App

This app is a simple note-taking tool that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes directly in their browser. Notes are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed. The interface is user-friendly, featuring a button to add new notes and a delete icon within each note. Additionally, the app prevents accidental line breaks from creating new paragraphs, keeping the note-taking experience seamless and efficient.
